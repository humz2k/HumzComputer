WIP!!!
 
I started this with the intention of writing an emulator for an architecture I came up with. I am realising now that the architecture is pretty dumb overall. However, I have written so much of it already that I figure I might as well complete it.

So, I'm going to use this as an exercise in bad architecture and compiler design. Trying to design a working compiler for an architecture that is pretty dumb.

### TODO: 
Macros.
Fix variable declarations.
