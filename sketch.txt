TYPE -> 2 bits
OPCODE -> 6 bits
RAMADDR -> 12 Bits
RAMADDR -> 12 Bits

RAM is made up of 1024 addresses with 32 bits each.

OPCODE of 1111 means the rest of the ram entry is data

Registers are 24 bits

Types:
signed -> 01
unsigned -> 10
instruction -> 11


Address Modes:
0 -> register
1 -> [register]
2 -> memory
3 -> [memory]

OPS (ALL CONSTS ARE UNSIGNED, AND IGNORE THE ADDRESSMODE BITS. CONSTS HAVE MAX OF 1023):
0 -> Load Const to Addr: const, addr
1 -> Inc Addr by Const: const, addr
2 -> Dec Addr by Const: const, addr
3 -> Copy Addr1 to Addr2: addr1, addr2
